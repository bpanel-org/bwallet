# bPanel bwallet

Work in progress.

### Usage

Use as a plugin with `bPanel`

Install using `bpanel-cli`

```js

$ bpanel-cli install @bpanel/bwallet
```

This will update the `bpanel` config file so that the plugins array contains `@bpanel/bwallet`.
`bpanel` will install the plugin during its build.
